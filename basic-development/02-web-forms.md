# Basic Development with Flask and Microblog

## Web Forms

### Introduction

Previously, I created a simple template for the home page of the 
application, and used fake objects as placeholders for things I don't 
have yet, like users or blog posts.

In this part, I'm going to fill one of those many holes I still have in 
this application, specifically how to accept input from users through 
web forms.

Web forms are one of the most basic building blocks in any web 
application. I will be using forms to allow users to submit blog posts, 
and also for logging in to the application.

Before you proceed here, make sure you have the *microblog* application 
as I left it in the previous part, and that you can run it without any 
errors.
