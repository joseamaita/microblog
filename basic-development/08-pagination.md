### Introduction

In the previous section, I have made several database changes necessary 
to support the "follower" paradigm that is so popular with social 
networks. With that functionality in place, I'm ready to remove the last 
piece of scaffolding that I have put in place in the beginning, the fake 
posts. In this section, the application will start accepting blog posts 
from users, and also deliver them in the home and profile pages.
