# Basic Development with Flask and Microblog

## Profile Page and Avatars

### Introduction

This section is going to be dedicated to adding user profile pages to 
the application. A user profile page is a page in which information 
about a user is presented, often with information entered by the users 
themselves. I will show you how to generate profile pages for all users 
dynamically, and then I'll add a small profile editor that users can use 
to enter their information.
